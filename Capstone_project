Required solution in Datawarehouse:

Data Elements Explanation

Data Modelling:

Upon the creation of above table, Data modelling to be created according to the result set which is generated as a report. Choose the correct partition column on the table wherever needed

Extraction:
All the data has to be stored  in hive warehouse.

Case Study 1

Identify which numbers made calls as well as made sms messages, where number of calls made should be more than 10 and number of messages should be more than 5.
Upon the output data , we can categorize these customers as privilege customers and cater their specific needs.

Case Study 2

Identify which users sent smses but did not make calls. These customers are one whose prime use is sms alone. These targeted customers should be rolled out with offers that cater to his specific need like good sms packages.

Case Study 3

Identify which users sent at least 10 more messages in the month of Jan than in the month of Feb. These customers can we specifically targeted with sms packages as their usage has increased from last month consumption and most likely to buy our targeted offers. And this can increase the revenue.

Case Study 4

 Spark Usecase
 ------------------

Use case: Curation

You are given curation.csv with schema as mentioned in the below box, which is having good and bad records.. Write all good records in one file and all bad records in another file. Store the files as valid_pc_account and invalid_pc_account as parquet file 

 
1)	Write Spark program to Validate if the records have PublicId starts with “pc:” and the Service Tier should be “Bronze or Gold or Platinum or Silver”
2)	If yes save it in valid_pc_account table, else save in invalid_pc_account
